                    Hi there, I'm James I'm <span id="myage">29</span> I was born and raised in London. I loved growing up in such a diverse place full of life with something intresting round every corner!
                    I studied Electrical and Electronic engineering at Plymouth university. I really enjoyed the more coding focused aspects of the course and late nights with a big group of us crowded
                     round a library table bouncing ideas off of each other. Unfortunately my enjoyment for those parts of the course were far outweighed by how much I hated the more physics heavy aspects
                      which led to me dropping out after my second year. I briefly moved to Montpellier in the south of France and then returned to London where I've been since. For the last 7 years I've 
                      been working as a bicycle mechanic in north London.

                <p>In a weird way I think there's quite a lot of overlap between my current job and being a web developer. Most of my day is spent tracking down faults on bikes, working out how to fix them
                    and then implementing the fix. Standards in cycling change needlesly frequently so I'm very used to tracking down technical documents and write ups for specific parts to make sure I understand 
                    how they work and what compatability issues there might be. My role is also customer facing so I'm fairly comfortable explaining complicated jargon laden problems to people with little 
                    knowledge of the subject. Over the last seven years some of my absolute favourite times have been sharing my knowledge with new apprentices or regular customers with time to kill. I'm 
                    hoping that becoming a web developer will let me continue doing the parts of my job I love the most whilst getting to learn new a whole new skill set and being a bit less taxing on my body.

                <p>I've really enjoyed working through the prerequisets for the course. It's been incredibly intresting seeing what happens behind the scenes, I've found myself opening the developer tools on 
                    firefox on pretty much every new website I visit trying to see how a certain feature was implemented. It's also been very eye opening finding out how much thought goes in to making the web
                     accessible for everyone, it's not something I'd ever really thought about before and I really appreciate getting this new perspective on the web.</p>
