                        Hi there, I'm James I'm <span id="myage">29</span> I was born and raised in London. I loved growing up in such a diverse place full of life with something intresting round every corner!
                        I studied Electrical and Electronic engineering at Plymouth university. I really enjoyed the more coding focused aspects of the course and late nights with a big group of us crowded
                         round a library table bouncing ideas off of each other. Unfortunately my enjoyment for those parts of the course were far outweighed by how much I hated the more physics heavy aspects
                          which led to me dropping out after my second year. I briefly moved to Montpellier in the south of France and then returned to London where I've been since. For the last 7 years I've
                          been working as a bicycle mechanic in north London.

                        and then implementing the fix. Standards in cycling change needlesly frequently so I'm very used to tracking down technical documents and write ups for specific parts to make sure I understand
                        how they work and what compatability issues there might be. My role is also customer facing so I'm fairly comfortable explaining complicated jargon laden problems to people with little
                        knowledge of the subject. Over the last seven years some of my absolute favourite times have been sharing my knowledge with new apprentices or regular customers with time to kill. I'm
                        hoping that becoming a web developer will let me continue doing the parts of my job I love the most whilst getting to learn new a whole new skill set and being a bit less taxing on my body.

                        firefox on pretty much every new website I visit trying to see how a certain feature was implemented. It's also been very eye opening finding out how much thought goes in to making the web
                         accessible for everyone, it's not something I'd ever really thought about before and I really appreciate getting this new perspective on the web.</p>

                        <p class="project1text projecttext text" id="project1text">For this project I had to build a webpage about a hobby I'm intrested in. The main focus of this page was getting started with Document Object Model (DOM). We had to display an up to date time on our webpage I also decided to add a countdown timer to get some extra experience using JavaScript and DOM. Once I'd managed to get my date displaying correctly I realised it wouldn't update unless I found a way to periodically call the relevant function,.Thankfully I came accross the setInterval() method quite quickly, using this I was able to call my function once every second I didn't know about CSS flex or grid at this point so everything is held in place with padding, I used percentages for my padding hoping it would help improve responsiveness. If I were to build this site again I think I would approach it in a different way. My stylesheet would definetly look quite different!</p>

                        <p class="project2text projecttext hidden text" id="project2text">For this project I made a gallery showcasing all the other projects I've done for the FaC prerequisties. This was an introduction to using flex display. One of the main challenges for this project was making sure that the content displayed in a certain way on different display sizes. I used the clamp() function in CSS to help achieve this. Clamp allowed me to set a minimum a maximum and a preffered size for my elements, this meant I was able to scale my elements to match the size of the display. One specific requirement was having my projects show in a single column on mobile devices. With lots of experimentation and pixel measuring I was able to achieve this using the clamp function. I think it would have been better to use a media query allowing me to effectively have a seperate stylesheet for mobile devices.</p>

                        <p class="project3text projecttext hidden text" id="project3text">This project was used as an introduction to JavaScript objects and how to manipulate them. I was given a small movie database and free reign on what to do with it as long as the user was able to interact with the data in some way. I'd already wanted to make a site that picked a random film to help with option paralysis on various streaming sites so I knew I wanted to have that functionality in my site. This was actually quite easy to implement, although I don't know how well my method would scale. I then wanted a way to see all titles available and finally make it possible to add your own film to the database. All of the functionality in this site relies heavily on the Object.keys() method, this helped me be able to display data about different films dynamically so that everything still worked when a new film was added. This project was very javascript heavy so there was a fair bit of debugging and fault finding along the way. I made constant use of console.log to check if I was actually reaching functions I wanted to and the values of various arrays, objects and other variables along the way. One point I got especcialy stuck on was stopping my form submit from refreshing the page, from lots of googling I managed to get it working the way I wanted, this issue gave me a chance to better understand the way JavaScript event handlers work (there's still a lot more to learn here!).<br>I actually did this project before the project gallery and I think it has suffered for that. I'm very happy with the functionality of the site but visually it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

                        <p class="project4text projecttext hidden text" id="project4text">This project was combining everything I'd learnt from previous projects in to a website about myself and why I'm intrested in web development with Founders and Coders. To start I sketched out some basic layouts for how I might want the site to look. I knew I wanted a splashcreen for my site but couldn't decide what that should look like. I came across a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhfQnmGXSwU">youtube video</a> by Hyperplexed showcasing a very cool splashscreen and breaking down how they would go about making it. Using this I made my own (admitedly very similar) version this introduced me to the data attribute in HTML and making use of it as a style selector in CSS. I wanted the splashcreen to be interactive so it made sense to have it navigate to a section of the mainsite. Then using data attributes I made it so the splashscreen buttons became my navigation bar, this meant I could keep my eventlisteners from the splashscreen and combine the splashscreen and navigation bar functions in to one.</p>
